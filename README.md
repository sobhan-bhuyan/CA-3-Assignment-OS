Answers to the assignment questions for CA-3 of Operating Systems.


Q 8. The following processes are being scheduled using a preemptive, round robin scheduling algorithm. Each process is assigned a numerical     priority, with a higher number indicating a higher relative priority. In addition to the processes listed below, the system also has an     idle task (which consumes no CPU resources and is identified as P_idle ). This task has priority 0 and is scheduled whenever the system     has no other available processes to run. The length of a time quantum is 10 units. If a process is preempted by a higher-priority            process, the preempted process is placed at the end of the queue. 
      Thread        Priority       Burst        Arrival 
        P1            40            20             0 
        P2            30            25            25 
        P3            30            25            30 
        P4            35            15            60 
        P5             5            10           100 
        P6            10            10           105
    Write a C code to  
    a. Show the scheduling order of the processes using a Gantt chart. 
    b. What is the turnaround time for each process? 
    c. What is the waiting time for each process? 
    d. What is the CPU utilization rate? 


Q 19. Ten students (s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8,s9,s10) are going to attend an event. There are lots of gift shops, they all are going to the gift shops and randomly picking the gifts. After picking the gifts they are randomly arriving in the billing counter. The accountant gives the preference to that student who has maximum number of gifts. Create a C program to define order of billed students?
